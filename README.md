## Objectives
- Identify phishing indicators in a sample email.
- Develop skills in analyzing email threats using tools like online header analyzers.
- Document findings in a clear, structured report.

## Tools Used
- **Email Client**: To view the sample email.
- **Online Header Analyzer**: MXToolbox (or similar) for header analysis.
- **Text Editor**: For reviewing raw email content and writing reports.

## How to Use
1. **Obtain Sample Email**: The `data/sample-email.txt` contains a raw phishing email sample.
2. **Analyze Headers**: Use an online tool like MXToolbox to analyze headers; results are saved in `docs/header-analysis.txt`.
3. **Review Report**: The `docs/report.md` contains the detailed analysis, including phishing indicators.
4. **Screenshots**: The `data/screenshots/email-screenshot.png` shows the email as displayed in a client, highlighting suspicious elements.

## Deliverables
- A report (`docs/report.md`) listing phishing characteristics.
- Header analysis output (`docs/header-analysis.txt`).
- Raw email text (`data/sample-email.txt`) for reference.
- Screenshot of the email (`data/screenshots/email-screenshot.png`) for visual context.
