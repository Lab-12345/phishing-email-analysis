# Analysis Notes
- **Received Header**: The originating IP (45.32.123.456) is not associated with PayPal's official mail servers. Reverse DNS lookup shows it belongs to a third-party hosting provider, not PayPal.
- **Reply-To Mismatch**: The "Reply-To" address (support@secure-paypal.net) differs from the sender's domain (paypal-support.com), indicating potential spoofing.
- **DKIM Failure**: The DKIM signature failed verification, suggesting the email was not sent by the claimed domain.
- **Spam Score**: A spam score of 4.5 indicates moderate suspicion, consistent with phishing characteristics.
- **Conclusion**: The header analysis confirms discrepancies typical of phishing emails, including non-official IP origins and authentication failures.
